# DSA-210-PROJECT
I am a student from Sabancı University, Aylin Yılmaz (32168), and this is my project which I will be testing whether using a phone before bed (total amount of phone usage during a day) negatively impacts sleep quality.

These two hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First hypothesis]**: Sleep quality has a negative correlation with screen time.
- **[Second hypothesis]**: Sleep quality has a neutral correlation with screen time
