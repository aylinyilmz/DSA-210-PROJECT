# DSA-210-PROJECT
### PROJECT IDEA
I am a student from Sabancı University, Aylin Yılmaz (32168), and this is my project which I will be testing for a month whether using a phone before bed and total amount of phone usage during a day negatively impacts sleep quality by analyzing data from Iphone's screen time  and Excel chart or Numbers app.

These two hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First hypothesis]**: Sleep quality is correlated with screen time.
- **[Second hypothesis]**: Sleep quality is not correlated with screen time

### MOTIVATION
As we live in a era of technology, we ultimately happen to be exposed to screens pretty much all the time in a daily life. And there exists a lot of researches, articles on this matter that states being exposed to screen throughout the day can significantly impact the quality of daily life in so many different aspects.By studying the data I acquired from a Screen Time tool and Excel, I aim to:
- Understand the relationship between screen usage and sleeping time.
- Acknowledge to which extent does being exposed to screen affects sleeping pattern.
- Use of tools and analyze the data with respect to the scientific approach. 

## **Description of Dataset**
- **Day of the week** : I will include the days between 11th of March and 11th of April. Also it can be specified by weekdays and weekends.
- **Total duration of screen** : The exact usage of phone using.
- **Total duration of screen before bed** : The exact usage of phone just before fallin asleep.
- **Total duration of sleep** : The exact amount of sleeping during the whole night.(in hours)
- **Night waking frequency** : The exat number of waking up during the night.

## **Project Plan**
- This project aims to uncover the patterns in sleeping quality across usage of phone by correlating data from Screen Time tool of Iphone and sleeping period by manually tracking data of following components: total screen time, screen time before bed, sleep duration and night waking frequency, on Excel chart.
- At the end of the data collection period, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be applied by using statistical and visualization techniques.

## **Tools for Data Analysis**
I'll will use following tools for visualization:
- **Pyhton** :For statistical analysis and data cleaning(if needed).
- **Google Collab** : For creating visualizations.
