# DSA-210-PROJECT
I am a student from Sabancı University, Aylin Yılmaz (32168), and this is my project which I will be testing for a month whether using a phone before bed (total amount of phone usage during a day) negatively impacts sleep quality by analyzing data from Iphone's screen time data and Excel chart or Numbers app.

These two hypotheses will be tested:
- **[First hypothesis]**: Sleep quality has a negative correlation with screen time.
- **[Second hypothesis]**: Sleep quality has a neutral correlation with screen time

## MOTIVATION
As we live in a world of technology, we ultimately happen to be exposed to screens pretty much all the time in a daily life. And there exists a lot of researches, articles on this matter that presents being exposed to screen throughout the day can significantly impact the quality of daily life in so many different aspects.By studying the data I acquired from a Screen Time tool and Excel, I aim to:
- Understand the relationship between screen usage and sleeping time.
- Acknowledge to which extent does being exposed to screen affects sleeping pattern.

## **Project Plan**
This project aims to uncover the patterns in sleeping quality across usage of phone by correlating data from a Screen Time tool of Iphone and sleeping time by manually tracking data of components which are screen time, sleep duration and night waking frequency on Excel chart.
